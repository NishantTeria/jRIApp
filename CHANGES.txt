VERSION CHANGES

VERSION 1.1:

Framework's modules were restructured and tidyed up.
Now the modules are really modules, they register types in their 'THIS' variables on the time of their
execution by the framework.
You can get module's types using app.modules.moduleName.typeName.

P.S. - app.registerType and app.getType methods are still working, but they used rarer in the internals,
and many types which are not used directly by the user code are not registered by registerType method.
Getting types by modules are preferable now.

Constants definition are now moved to their related modules, only global costants which are used in many
modules are preserved global.

Two methods for registering and obtaining the converters are now application's methods (not global's).
You can use app.getConverter and app.registerConverter.

The type BindingContentFactory which creates content types is now can be easily replaced to provide 
user's extended version which can create more content types than the default version. Application exposes
property bindingContentFactory, where you can set your extended version.

global.consts.Key enumeration was renamed to global.consts.KEYS
 

VERSION 1.2:
breaking changes:
templates need attribute data-role="template"
the templates which are loaded individually don't need it, but it does not hurt to add it.
It is needed because templates now all need internal preprocessing, and they need to be distinguished not only by their ids.

nonbreaking changes:
 
1) Added dynamic loading of templates from server 
2) Added new element view "dynacontent" which can display templated content with switching of template and dataContext
3) Added new event 'load' to the Global object which is equivalent to jQuery.ready event - only more framework friendly.   
4) And restructured some code


docs will be updated shortly. At present GridDemo has a lot of comments to track new features.
